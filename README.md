# Genetic based Decision-Tree in Python
This repository contains an implementation of **Decision Tree Classifier** which employs **Genetic Algorithm** for finding the best possible split on every node of the tree. 

## About Decision-tree
A decision tree is a decision support hierarchical model that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning. A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules [[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)]. An example of decision tree:

## About Genetic-algorithm
In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. Some examples of GA applications include optimizing decision trees for better performance, solving sudoku puzzles, hyperparameter optimization, causal inference, etc. [[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)].
